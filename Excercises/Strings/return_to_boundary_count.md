# Ant on the Boundary

For more details, see the [LeetCode Problem Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/ant-on-the-boundary/description/)

## Initial Approach

I employed a simple iterative approach that involves updating a running sum (boundary_distance) and tracking the occurrences where it equals zero. This approach avoids using additional data structures and works efficiently for this problem since its time complexity is O(n).

## Optimized Solution

Not available yet.

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where n is the length of the input list nums.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, as no additional data structures are used. Only a few variables are employed to track the running sum and the result, keeping the memory usage constant.
