# LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my repository of LeetCode problem solutions! 🚀

A collection of LeetCode problems I've solved, organized by topic. This repository serves as both a personal learning tracker and a showcase of my problem-solving journey. The solutions are primarily written in Python, with detailed documentation and comments to explain the thought process behind each approach.

## Topics Covered

- [Arrays ](./Exercises/Arrays/)
- [Bit Manipulation](./Exercises/Bit%20Manipulation/)
- [Dynamic Programming](./Exercises/Dynamic%20Programming/)
- [Graphs](./Exercises/Graphs/)
- [Greedy Algorithms](./Exercises/Greedy/)
- [Hash Tables](./Exercises/Hash%20Table/)
- [Math](./Exercises/Math/)
- [Sliding Window](./Exercises/Sliding%20Window/)
- [Strings](./Exercises/Strings/)
- [Trees](./Exercises/Trees/)
- [Two Pointers](./Exercises/Two%20Pointers/)
