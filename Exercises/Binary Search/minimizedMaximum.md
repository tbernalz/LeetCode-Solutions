# Minimized Maximum of Products Distributed to Any Store

For more details, see the [LeetCode Problem Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimized-maximum-of-products-distributed-to-any-store/description/).

## Initial Approach

The initial approach involves using a binary search strategy to efficiently determine the minimum possible maximum number of products given to any store. The idea is to search for the smallest value `x` such that the total number of stores required to distribute all products (with each store receiving at most `x` products of any type) does not exceed `n`.

1. **Binary Search Setup**: The search space is between 1 (the minimum possible `x`) and the maximum value in `quantities` (the worst-case `x` where one store gets all products of one type).

1. **Mid Calculation**: For each midpoint `mid` in the search space, calculate the total number of stores needed if each product type is distributed in chunks of size `mid` (using ceiling division).

1. **Adjust Search Space**: If the calculated stores needed is within the allowed n, try to find a smaller `x` by searching the left half. Otherwise, search the right half for a feasible `x`.

## Optimized Solution

Not available yet.

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(m * log(max(quantities)))`, where m is the length of the quantities array.

- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, as no additional data structures are used, and all operations are performed in-place.
