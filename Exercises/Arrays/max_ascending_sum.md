# Maximum Ascending Subarray Sum

For more details, see the [LeetCode Problem Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-ascending-subarray-sum/description/).

## Initial Approach

1. **Iterate Through the Array**:

   - Traverse the array from left to right while comparing the current element with the previous one to determine if the subarray is still ascending.

1. **Maintain Running Sums**:

   - Use a helper variable to store the sum of the current ascending subarray.
   - Use a result variable to keep track of the maximum sum encountered.

1. **Handle Breaks in Ascending Order**:

   - If the current number is less than or equal to the previous number, reset the helper variable to the current number, as a new subarray starts.

1. **Update Result**:

   - Continuously update the result variable if helper exceeds its value.

This approach ensures that the maximum sum of any ascending subarray is computed in a single pass through the array.

## Optimized Solution

Not available yet.

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where n is the length of the array.

- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, as no additional data structures are used, and all operations are performed in-place.
