# Minimum Operations to Make the Array Increasing

For more details, see the [LeetCode Problem Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-make-the-array-increasing/description/).

## Initial Approach

The initial approach is an iterative strategy that ensures the array becomes strictly increasing by incrementing elements as needed. It starts by iterating through the array from the second element and compares each element with its predecessor.

If the current element is less than or equal to the previous element, it calculates the required increment to make the current element greater than the previous one. This increment is added to the current element, and the total number of operations is updated accordingly. This process continues until the entire array is strictly increasing.

## Optimized Solution

Not available yet.

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where n is the number of elements in the list.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, as no additional data structures are used, and all operations are performed in-place.
