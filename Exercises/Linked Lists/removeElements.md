# Remove Linked List Elements

For more details, see the [LeetCode Problem Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-linked-list-elements/description/).

## Initial Approach

The initial approach involves iterating through the linked list while keeping track of the previous node. This allows us to bypass nodes that have the target value (`val`). We also ensure that we correctly identify and return the new head of the linked list after removing all nodes with the specified value.

## Optimized Solution

Not available yet.

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.

- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, as no additional data structures are used, and all operations are performed in-place.
